## Alpagu Blog and Personal Website Project

**Technologies used:**
- Laravel 11
- InertiaJS
- React 18

**Libraries used:**
- alpagu-icons (Icon Library)
- boxicons (Icon Library)
- Bootstrap 5 (Front-End Toolkit)
- i18n (internationalization framework)

 **Created Libraries:**
- **Rating Component**:
	*We have created a rating library that works like rating-stars. Give it a value, colors and sizes of rating stars and it will generate it.*
	
- **Customizer Component**:
	*A component that allows you to change your site's theme modes (dark, light) in real time and manage the i18n library (Language change).*
	
- **Live Chat Component**:
	*It is a component that allows you to send real-time messages to the site owner (me) and have instant chats with me. It is currently closed. I will make it available when I develop a mobile application compatible with the site.*
